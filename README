== About Windows Programming in D ==
    This is a translation project of Charles Petzold's Programming Windows (5th edition) book 
    code samples.
    
    The code samples show the use of various Windows API systems, such as GDI and multimedia. 
    There are over 140 C code samples from the original book, all of which will be translated
    to D (most already are).
    
    This project has been created by Andrej Mitrovic.

== Latest Update  ==
    22nd June 2011 - Added single-project compilation by CD-ing to the directory and issuing
                     the call `rdmd ..\..\..\build "%cd%`
    21st June 2011 - Built and tested on WinXP 32bit and Windows7 32bit systems with DMD v2.053.

== Building Requirements ==
    - XP 32bit or Win7 32bit system, 64bit versions haven't been tested but they might work 
      (let me know if it works for you or not).
      
      Non-NT systems are not suppported.

    - DMD v2.053 compiler. Download it from: http://www.digitalmars.com/d/download.html
      Usage instructions (nice bookmark): http://d-programming-language.org/dmd-windows.html
      
    Note: If you can't compile the samples with a newer version of DMD, file a bug report or 
    send me an e-mail (see the contact section), and I'll fix the samples as soon as possible.

== Building ==
    - Make sure you've installed DMD and have it in the PATH environment variable.
        If you don't know how to set up environment variables, see this guide: 
        http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm
    
    - Build the samples by issuing this call from the command line:
        rdmd build.d
        
    - To build only a single example, CD to its directory and run:
        rdmd ..\..\..\build.d "%cd%"
        
    - To enable the console and add debug symbols, append debug to the call:
        rdmd ..\..\..\build.d "%cd%" debug
        
    Note: The quotes are important
    Note: The script will likely emit some warnings, but you don't have to worry about those.
        
    Other options are:
    - Clean .obj, .map, .exe files:
        rdmd build.d clean
        
    - Debug version that spawns a console for printing, and builds with debug flags for 
      debugging via ddbg:
        rdmd build.d debug
    
    If there are any errors when building you should get an information error message back.

    Note: Currently parallel builds are not incorporated. This is due to a bug related to how 
          the chdir() call works.
    Note: At the time of writing DMD can't build 64 binaries. Alternatively the GDC compiler
          could be used, however at the time of writing it doesn't seem to support pragma lib
          linking. 

== Optional Tools ==
    - HTOD: http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/htod.html    
        HTOD needs to be in your PATH. It's probably best to put it in the \DMD2\Windows\Bin 
        directory.

    - Microsoft RC compiler and header files. Without these the build script will use 
      precompiled .res files.
        - Get it from:        
        http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=c17ba869-9671-4330-a63e-1fd44e0e2505&displaylang=en
        - RC needs to be in your PATH if you want to compile resources.
        
        Note: This is a big download, depending on what you select in the setup.
        Note: DigitalMars have a resource compiler, but it still requires header files. 
              See the "Using Resources in D" Tutorial in the Links section.

        - Create the RCINCLUDES environment variable and add paths to the header files needed
          by the RC resource compiler. 
          On an XP system these paths could be:
            C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Include
            C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include
            C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\atlmfc\include
            
          Typically the include paths for resource header files are different on each system, 
          so you will have to adjust these.    
              
        Note: The build script will attempt to find these default paths if you don't have 
              RCINCLUDES already set up.
        Note: Setting up an environment variable might require you to log off and log on
              again before the build script can pick up the new changes.

    - The uncrustify executable bundled with UniversalIndentGUI could be outdated compared to
      the latest Uncrustify version.
      Please see the Uncrustify homepage in the Links section in this Readme to get the
      latest binary or to compile from source.

== Contact ==
    Please do not e-mail Charles Petzold about bugs in these examples,
    any bugs or inconsistencies in the D examples are entirely my fault.

    To contact me, send me a message via Github @ https://github.com/AndrejMitrovic, 
    or e-mail me at: andrej.mitrovich<at>gmail.com

== Todo ==
    - Drown RC noise when building.
    - Check if examples compile and run on Vista.
    - Maybe replace the duplicated winmain() functions with a wrapper.
    - Use with statements where possible.
    - Examples in Chap21\todo are fully functional, however they require DMD 2.054 due to the
      function imports feature, which hasn't been released yet at time of writing.
    - Examples in Chap22\todo have not been translated yet.
    - Try compiling 64bit binaries via GDC.
    - Some examples have a Note at the top, saying they're not tested. They need to be
      investigated to see what's wrong.
    - Replace calls to wsprintf in Chap18\EmfView18.d with std.string.format(). (Note: 
      wsprintf returns the length of the written string)
    - Get rid of malloc/free calls and replace pointers with arrays where appropriate.
    - Replace Windows type aliases like TCHAR to wchar, since I'm exclusively using Unicode. 
    - Replace excessive string copying with saner code. This is mostly caused by my own 
      lazyness (This will be improved upon later. I mean the examples, not my lazyness :p).
    - Go through the Errata pages to see if any examples have resource leaks or other bugs, 
      and fix the equivalent D examples.
    - In many cases variables with Hungarian notation should be renamed. Most pTypeVar 
      variables no longer reflect their true type.
    - Various syntax issues were left unresolved. In particular the C code used the form 
      `TEXT("SomeString")` throughout the code to make it Unicode-safe. I simply replaced 
      most of these calls by removing the TEXT symbol, which left a lot of weird-looking 
      `("SomeString")` code snippets. The parenthesis need to go.
    - For loops should be replaced with foreach loops where this makes sense. For loops work 
      fine in most cases, but I prefer the latter.
    - Due to the usage of a prewritten main.d prototype there are a lot of unecessary imports 
      in various modules. Removing them would be tedious by hand, and there doesn't seem to 
      be any tool yet that could help us resolve this.
    - UpdDemo was not ported since it cannot work due to a missing FTP server. See Errata2 in 
      the links section, Chapter23.

    Note: If you find any bugs that you'd like to fix or just want to improve the examples, 
          feel free to contribute by forking the repo and making pull requests.

== How the examples were ported ==
    A few notes about the issues found when porting C code to D can be read about here:
    http://www.digitalmars.com/webnews/newsgroups.php?art_group=digitalmars.D.announce&article_id=20764

    I've made a stub file which contains the basic winmain function which calls mywinmain to 
    set things up.
    Originally I've made a batch file build script but replaced this with a more safer D
    build script which doesn't assume you have all the dependencies and will warn you about
    errors.

    The porting process is:
    - Run Uncrustify on the file to format the code to a specific look.
      A configuration file that was used with Uncrustify is provided in the root directory.
    - Copy the contents of the stub file, paste it at the top of an existing .c project. See 
      the .c file's winmain function and see if there's anything different (i.e. the app 
      might have keyboard translators, or it creates menus and windows programatically, 
      etc.). Copy any new or changed stuff to our D MyWinMain function.
    - If the app uses resources just uncomment the "import resource;" statement.
    - Change 'appName' to match the .c file's 'szAppName'. This is important as resources are 
      usually tied to a name and won't load unless you specify the exact name.
    - Convert -> to .
    - Change all TCHAR[] types to either strings, and then use toUTF16z when calling WinAPI 
      functions, or change them to wchar[] if they're going to be written to.
    - To call WinAPI functions which require the character length, I've used std.utf.count,
      which returns the count of code points. Using the .length field directly would be
      incorrect, as that is the code unit count, not code point count.
    - Change "LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc" to "extern (Windows) LRESULT WndProc"
    - Add default cases to all switch statements.
    - Change fallbacks to "goto case;" statements (fallback are banned in 2.054+)
    - Change sizeof(var) to var.sizeof
    - Replace inline calls to wsprintf such as:      
      TextOut(hdc, 0, y += cyChar, szBuffer, wsprintf(szBuffer, ("lfWidth = %i"), lf.lfWidth));
        
        to this (also replace any special specifiers with %s):
            szBuffer = format("lfWidht = %s", lf.lfWidth);
            TextOut(hdc, 0, y += cyChar, szBuffer.toUTF16z, szBuffer.count);
    
    - Pass static and dynamic arrays by using their .ptr field. 
    - Floats and Doubles are default-initialized to NaN. This causes hardware halts or throws 
      exceptions, based on the configuration. Since C doesn't have this initializer, most C 
      code doesn't explicitly initialize floats/doubles to 0.0. A good way to catch exactly 
      where a fault occured is to use the DDBG debugger.

    At this point I try to compile and I usually get a list of errors, which is nice because 
    I get back the line numbers for invalid code. Then I usually have to fix the following:
    - For linker errors, it probably means we're missing a pragma call. E.g. if you import 
      'import win32.wingdi;', you should also add 'pragma(lib, "gdi32.lib");'. The WindowsAPI 
      modules each have a pragma at the top which you can copy into your projects.
    - Change implicit casts e.g. (HBRUSH)GetStockObject to cast(HBRUSH)GetStockObject
    - Change assignment of strings to fields that expect pointers by using .toUTF16z
    - Change any malloc and free calls to GC.malloc and GC.free (there are plenty left)
    - 'PNTR var = GC.malloc()' itself has to be replaced with 'PNTR var = 
      cast(typeof(var))GC.malloc().
    - Change C-style struct initializers with explicit D ctor calls. This is always 
      problematic to convert, but it helps if your editor supports macros or simultaneous 
      multiline editing.
    - Change C-style multidimensional arrays to D ones. Sometimes it's a simple conversion of 
      TCHAR[][] to string[].
    - Replace calls to TEXT("string") to either ("string") or "string". Either will work, 
      while the conversion to latter might be harder to automate unless you're a happy regex 
      hacker.
    - Fix implicit conversions of 0 to void*, this won't compile in D so we use null here 
      instead.
    - Sometimes calls to LOWORD and HIWORD have to be casted to a short or some other type. 
      In some C examples this was missing and produced erratic GUI behavior due to various 
      implicit unsigned int<>short conversions. (See Chap7/BlokOut2/BlokOut2.c and its 
      executable for an example. Try making a selection beyond the border of the window to 
      see the bug.)
    - Change static vars to enums where appropriate. Some statics are used as immutable 
      values in C, in those cases we can use enums (this might not always work due to CTFE 
      limitations).
    - Replace comparisons with null with 'is null' and '!is null'.
    - Add any missing imports. There are usually two cases:
      1. We're missing a winapi prototype, so we find it in the WindowsAPI library and do an 
         import to a specific module.
      2. There was a .c file with various functions which is used in multiple examples. 
         Sometimes its missing in the current directory, so I had to copy it from the other 
         examples.
    - Some API calls write to a static array by giving them the .ptr field of such an array. 
      To retrieve a D string out of such an array, we have to treat it as a wchar* 
      zero-terminated string. So I've had to write a fromWStringz function for this purpose. 
      This should all be avoided by writing better code, code like this will be improved later.

    Additional changes:
    - Put BeginPaint and EndPaint next to each other by using 'scope(exit) EndPaint' after 
      the call to BeginPaint. Same thing for SelectObject - DeleteObject.
    - Speed issues: There was an example or two where the speed of drawing shapes was 
      extremely fast (the book was written for 1998 machines). In those cases I've added a 
      call to Thread.sleep() in the example's drawing loop.
    - Replace for loops with foreach loops.

    Final steps:
    - Make sure the example compiles and actually runs and performs the same as the C example 
      (unless the C example was buggy to begin with). There are various things to notice at 
      this stage that can be caused by accidents:
        - Missing menus
        - Missing or incorrect icons (e.g. forgot to replace a call like 'LoadIcon(NULL, 
          IDI_APPLICATION);' to 'LoadIcon(NULL, IDI_INFORMATION);
        - Incorrect background color (e.g. used 'wndclass.hbrBackground = cast(HBRUSH) 
          GetStockObject(WHITE_BRUSH);' instead of 'wndclass.hbrBackground = cast(HBRUSH) 
          GetStockObject(BLACK_BRUSH);'
        - I could have forgot to uncomment "import resource;" in the code.
